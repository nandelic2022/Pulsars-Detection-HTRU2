# Pulsars-Detection-HTRU2

This repository provides the code developed and used in the paper "Improvement of Pulsars Detection Using Dataset Balancing Methods and Symbolic Classification Ensemble". The dataset used in this research is a publicly availabe dataset HTRU2 which you can download at UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/372/htru2 or Kaggle 


The HTRU2.csv consist of following columns: 
1. Mean of the integrated profile.
2. Standard deviation of the integrated profile.
3. Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.
4. Skewness of the integrated profile.
5. Mean of the DM-SNR curve.
6. Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve.
7. Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve.
8. Skewness of the DM-SNR curve.
